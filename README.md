# Used-Cars-Cost-Prediction
Objective:
To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the prices of used cars based on various features.

Tools:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
  
Project Context:
This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship program at Acmegrade.

Process:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant features.
- Encoded categorical variables.
  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyzed relationships between different features and car prices.
- Identified key factors influencing car prices.
- Created visualizations to illustrate data insights.
  
3. Data Preprocessing:
- Normalized numerical features to ensure consistent scale.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
  
4. Model Development:
- Applied various regression algorithms, including:
Linear Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
- Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
  
5. Model Evaluation:
- Used metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- Achieved 92% accuracy in price predictions.
  
Outcome:
Successfully created a robust model that accurately predicts used car prices, demonstrating proficiency in data science techniques and machine learning algorithms.
